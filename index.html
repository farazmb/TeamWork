    <h1>Merge Conflict Example</h1>
    <p>This is an example of a merge conflict in a Git repository.</p>
    <p>When two branches have changes in the same part of a file, Git cannot
    automatically merge them and marks the file as having a conflict.</p>
    <p>To resolve the conflict, you need to manually edit the file to choose
    which changes to keep.</p>
    <p>I am Aymon and I am the prettiest</p>
    <p>No Aymon is better </p>
    <p>After resolving the conflict, you can stage the file and commit the changes.</p>
    <p>For more information on resolving merge conflicts, visit the
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_to     _resolve_conflicts">Git documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>Additional line added in the feature branch.</p>
