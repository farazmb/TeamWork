    <h1>Merge Conflict Example</h1>
    <p>This is an example of a merge conflict in a Git repository.</p>
    <p>When two branches have changes in the same part of a file, Git cannot
    automatically merge them and marks the file as having a conflict.</p>
    <p>To resolve the conflict, you need to manually edit the file to choose
    which changes to keep.</p>
